# Raytracing-Simulation
This is a simple raytracing simulation using Java Swing that was made for a school project. The simulation consists of a spherical object and a spherical light source that casts light onto the object and the surrounding walls of the simulation room. Each room of the wall is created as an object. This is not advanced raytracing but uses a simple principle based on inverse square law and trigonometry to find the distance between object and lightsource.

Code is not optimized as it is one of my first attempts creating a Java project. Looking to return to the project and create a better mechanism for light casting to improve performance as well as improving and cleaning the code.
